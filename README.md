#Jenkins Dashboard

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benmatselby/atom-jenkins-dashboard.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benmatselby/atom-jenkins-dashboard)

**I am no longer maintaining this plugin, sorry**

This plugin aims to allow you to interact with a Jenkins installation from within the [Atom](https://atom.io/) environment

This is currently very much work in progress, see [here](https://github.com/benmatselby/atom-jenkins-dashboard/issues) for features/issues
